            <p>
                My name is Timothy O'Malley, an apsiring Software Engineer/Web Developer. In college I worked with C and C++ and have a pretty strong foundation those. I am currently
                a mechanincal engineer that does HVAC engineering for industrial/commercial buildings. This isn't directly related to software/web development I think a lot of the 
                problem solving skills I have from engineering will be applicable in a the tech industry.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently taking a 6 month coding bootcamp at Northwestern University to get the skills necessary to become a full stack web developer. As of now we have done a 
                lot of work with HTML and CSS, and just started to dabble into javascript. The loayout of this Portfoliois a good example of the HTML and CSS that I have learned so far.
                I don't have any projects showing off any javascript yet but I will update that in as they come.
